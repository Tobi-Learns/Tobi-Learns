### 🚀 What I'm Looking For

I'm actively looking for **internships** or **employment opportunities** in Web3 — on either the **business side** (like product or strategy) or the **technical side** (development, smart contracts).  
If you’re building something exciting, I’d love to hear from you.

### 🧪 Why This Exists

Everything here is a work in progress — code, notes, experiments, and ideas.  
I'm learning out loud and sharing as I grow. If you're on a similar path, let’s build together.
